AI was used to help write documentation and to identify potential edge cases. In practice, AI often proposes code that is not synthesizable, so its role in RTL generation has been limited to documentation, analysis, and repetitive tasks. In particular, for the time‑to‑cycles computation the AI struggled to grasp the difference between synthesis‑friendly integer code with elaboration/simulation‑friendly implementations
